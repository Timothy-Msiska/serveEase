# 🍸 ServeEase App – Smart Table Ordering System

## 📖 Introduction
The **ServeEase App** is a modern mobile solution designed to simplify and enhance the ordering process in clubs, restaurants, and lounges.  
Instead of waiting for a waiter, customers can **scan a QR code** at their table to view the **digital menu** and **place orders directly** from their smartphones or provided tablets.  

This system enhances customer satisfaction, reduces service wait times, and increases operational efficiency for staff and management.
